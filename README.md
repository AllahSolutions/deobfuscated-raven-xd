# Deobfuscated Raven XD
Raven XD is now closed source, it didn't last this way for too long, though.

### Why?
Raven XD was an opensource client that is skidded from 100 other cheats without any credit. It was fine as long as it was opensource, but making this closed source to us looks like a step in the direction of it eventually becoming paid, which is, in our opinion, unethical.
